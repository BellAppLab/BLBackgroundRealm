BLBackgroundRealm is a collection of handy classes and extensions that make it easier to work with `Realm` in the background.

It's main focus is to enhance existing `Realm`s and Realm-based code bases with very little overhead and refactoring.

**Note**: Although this module makes it more convenient to work with a `Realm` in the background, it does **not** make  `Realm`s nor its objects thread-safe. They should still be accessed only from within their appropriate thread.

For the Swift counterpart, see [BackgroundRealm](https://github.com/BellAppLab/BackgroundRealm).
